<p>I&rsquo;ve come across a similar idea in <a href="https://philosophybites.com/2014/03/david-papineau-on-philosophy-and-sport.html">this podcast</a>: that <em>the fact of believing in something</em> makes it more likely to happen. This can be true in mountaineering (James&rsquo; example), sport (as in the podcast), or in business, which I&rsquo;ve always thought takes extraordinary self-belief: most businesses fail, so one has to wilfully ignore the laws of probability in order to start a new one, yet countless people do, and society benefits from their appetite for risk.</p>
<p>As someone who tends towards &ldquo;rationalism&rdquo; (using the term colloquially), I struggle to understand this impulse. How does one ignore reality and leap ahead into something, convincing oneself that is true? And, at what point should reality be allowed to once again influence one&rsquo;s decision-making? The perenially loss-making business foolhardily propelled into an avalanche of red ink comes to mind.</p>
<p><img src="/img/wework.jpg" alt="Look before you leap?"></p>
<p>This is also relevant in what we might might call &ldquo;self-help&rdquo;. Common advice goes that one should &ldquo;be oneself&rdquo; and not worry about what other people think. And sure, confidence is attractive. But judgements from others are also a way in which society communicates; obviously one doesn&rsquo;t want to entirely cut oneself off from what others think. Say someone has an intensely annoying laugh, something which causes anyone with normal hearing deep psychic pain - wouldn&rsquo;t it be more reasonable for him to try change it, rather than soldier on believing that others should just accept him?</p>
<p>But maybe I&rsquo;m too rational to understand all this&hellip;</p>
