the Making of the Modern World. He talks about Kublai Khan&rsquo;s conquest
of China, and his assiduous use of propaganda. While the Mongols fought
the Song in Southern China and tried to unite the country, they were
able to change their public perception from that of foreign invaders to
be cast out, to that of new rulers, graced by heaven, who gained
legitimacy with every new victory. Many people defected to them and were
treated fairly. ">

<p>Probably the leaders of all the great powers today suspect that their
narratives might not be true, and that destiny might not actually carry
them forward. But they hope it to be the case, and try to convince
others. Perhaps that is all that is necessary.</p>
