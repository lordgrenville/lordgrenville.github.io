    <section><p>I&rsquo;ve been working at home this week, and leaving the windows open, as I
like doing in all but the hottest weather. But I&rsquo;ve been bothered by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aedes_albopictus#/media/File:Aedes_Albopictus.jpg">these
guys</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/img/Aedes_Albopictus.jpg" alt="Aedes Albopictus (public domain image via the Centre for DiseaseControl)"></p>
<p>Googling mosquitoes with zebra-striped abdomens reveals that this is a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aedes_albopictus">tiger mosquito</a>, an
aggressive invader from SE Asia. Ranked as one of the hundred worst
invasive species, it originally spread on packing crates and has
penetrated most of the world, first being seen in Israel in 2003. And
besides for worse things, such as being disease vectors, they are
unusually awful pests: they hunt by day, unlike regular mozzies, and can
easily adapt to living in almost any human habitat, not needing a humid
bog. I can testify to their peculiarly aggressive nature, not minding
being brushed away or swatted at, persisting until finding blood.</p>
<p>One of the side-effects of globalisation is the cross-pollination of
nonhuman species all over the world, and simple Darwinism makes it
likely that the strongest contenders from foreign environments will
quickly take over many others (note the invasive Indian Mynahs and crows
so prevalent here). It seems inevitable that this will result in a
significant reduction in biodiversity. (The WWF claimed <a href="https://qz.com/1443473/wwf-living-planet-report-says-humans-wiped-out-60-of-animals-since-1970/">in a report
this
week</a>
that 60% of species had been wiped out since 1970.) This seems
unpreventable, hard to track, and there might even be some unanticipated
positive consequences. But it is a remarkable phenomenon.</p>

<p>A doctor recommended I have a mole taken out, so I went to a plastic
surgeon, who said it was unnecessary, but he could do it anyway. &ldquo;OK,&rdquo; I
said. &ldquo;OK what?&rdquo; he asked, with typical Israeli patience. &ldquo;Well, you say
no, she says yes - how can I know what to do?&rdquo; He waved his hand. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
worry about it, you can rely on me. It&rsquo;s the easiest thing to prescribe
an op. That&rsquo;s not called being a doctor! Anyone could say that. It takes
knowledge to say, it&rsquo;s not necessary.&rdquo; It reminded me a bit of doctrine
of <a href="https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%97_%D7%93%D7%94%D7%99%D7%AA%D7%A8%D7%90_%D7%A2%D7%93%D7%99%D7%A3">כוחא דהיתרא
עדיף</a>
(Beitza 2b) - anyone can prohibit something, but it takes a scholar to
permit it!</p>

<p>On the way back from the doctor I walked past BMXers doing tricks
outside the Cinematheque. What they do is unreal, Matrix stuff; it seems
to override the law of gravity.</p>
