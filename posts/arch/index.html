<h1 class="content-title">Notes from Installing Arch Linux</h1></section>

    

    <section><p>About six months ago I downloaded <a href="https://archlinux.org/download/">the Arch ISO</a> and stuck it on a thumb drive. I finally got around to installing it now - I was nervous about accidentally nuking my computer, so didn&rsquo;t want to try dual-boot the way I would with a distro with a graphical installer, and <a href="https://github.com/yuk7/ArchWSL">running it via WSL</a> would be missing the point. I finally got my hands on an old laptop I could mess around with and did it.</p>
<p>Overall, it was pretty simple following the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide">installation guide from the Wiki</a>. The only hairy bit was editing my disk partitions via <code>fdisk</code> - I relied on <a href="https://itsfoss.com/install-arch-linux/">this guide</a> at that point. But there were two notable issues which held me up.</p>
<p>The first was expired PGP keys. I ran into a lot of <code>Key could not be verified locally</code> messages while installing, and one page told me to update my keyring with <code>pacman -Su archlinux-keyring</code>. This resulted in trying to install a lot more software and running out of space in my thumb drive. I also tried deleting everything in <code>/etc/pacman.d/gnupg</code> and rerunning <code>pacman-key --init &amp;&amp; pacman-key --populate archlinux</code>, all to no avail. Eventually I just downloaded the newest version, overwrote it onto my thumb drive, and began from scratch. This time it worked.</p>
<p>The other major issue I had was with BIOS vs UEFI. It seemed like my machine was using the legacy BIOS boot, since there was no directory called <code>/sys/firmware/efi</code>. Based on this I initially created just one partition, <code>/dev/sda</code>, on which I mounted root based on <a href="https://itsfoss.com/install-arch-linux/">the above-mentioned guide</a>. After installing and rebooting, I got stuck in a boot loop where the machine was turning to the router and asking for a DHCP lease&hellip;apparently skipping past the HDD boot medium and trying to boot from the network! That is, it didn&rsquo;t recognise that there was an OS installed. I once again started over (the installation process is pretty quick, so this isn&rsquo;t such a big deal) and redid it while adding <code>/dev/sda1</code> for UEFI and <code>/dev/sda2</code> for root. This time it worked smoothly, so apparently I did need the ESP partition?</p>
<p>A final note: Arch doesn&rsquo;t include sudo with its basic install, so you can just grab it with pacman. But note that if you first created a non-root user, you get a &ldquo;naughty, naughty&rdquo; message when trying to use sudo as no-root. I had to set a default <code>\$EDITOR</code>, and then call <code>visudo</code> and add myself to sudo-capable users. Once I had this I installed <code>yay</code>, Firefox, and vim and called it a day.</p>
