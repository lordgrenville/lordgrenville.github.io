    <section><p>There&rsquo;s a great quote from Douglas Adams&rsquo; posthumous final novel, <em>The Salmon of Doubt</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anything that is in the world when you’re born is normal and ordinary and is just a natural part of the way the world works.</p>
<p>Anything that&rsquo;s invented between when you’re fifteen and thirty-five is new and exciting and revolutionary and you can probably get a career in it.</p>
<p>Anything invented after you&rsquo;re thirty-five is against the natural order of things.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is applicable to a lot of things - politics, say. There&rsquo;s a common stereotype that people become more conservative as they age. Logically we could see most people becoming more politically aware in their late teens/twenties, and then seeing those new politics as the way forward. As they become older, newer innovations just seem wrong. I think I recall Paul Krugman saying on a podcast that older members of the Federal Reserve are more opposed to keeping interest rates low, because they remember the high interest rates of the &rsquo;70s. Younger members, who have never experienced high inflation, are more concerned about the labour market and willing to consider low rates in the longer term. Even though this seems like a simple, easily noticed cognitive bias, it can be hard to countermand.</p>
<p>In a more prosaic sense, I find as I get older that I am less and less interested in discovering new music. It isn&rsquo;t that I think new music is less good; I just <em>know enough</em> music! And likewise, to a lesser extent, with TV and movies: I have enough to get by, I don&rsquo;t need any more. Of course one could make an effort to overcome this, by constantly exposing oneself to new stuff, it just takes work - there are plenty of people who keep up with new gadgets or music well into old age. But it doesn&rsquo;t seem worth it to most people. Perhaps in the political sphere the effort is more worthwhile.</p>
