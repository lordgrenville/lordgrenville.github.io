    <section><p>Problem: I have an app I like. I want to make a trivial change to the text in one screen. Emailed the developer, he said I could just edit the file in the <code>assets</code> folder and sideload it (although he failed to see the point of the edit&hellip;)</p>
<p>Background: an APK is just a zipped archive, you can unzip it and edit the text files, then zip, rename to a <code>.apk</code> extension and try install it (easiest is <code>adb install /path/to/app.apk</code>). Since an Android app is compiled, most of the decompressed files will be binaries, but not all - some simple things are in plain text, including the ones I wanted to change.</p>
<p>Solved? Not quite. For security reasons, Android requires the app to be <em>signed</em>, so once I edited it and sent it back, it was lacking a signature and I got the error <code>Failure [INSTALL_PARSE_FAILED_NO_CERTIFICATES]</code>. OK, how do I sign it? The <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing">Android Studio docs</a> have detailed instructions. I downloaded Android Studio, and hit a wall - the menu option <code>Build &gt; Generate Signed Bundle/APK</code> just didn&rsquo;t exist on the menu. I looked at some online advice, but none of it helped. Anyway, I just wanted to generate a key pair, do I really need an entire IDE for that? Apparently not, the IDE is using a tool that comes with Java called <code>jarsigner</code> but I wasn&rsquo;t able to find this in my <code>%JAVA\_HOME%</code> and also hit permission issues (I was using WSL on Windows which may have been part of the cause).</p>
<p>Anyway, I eventually found a &ldquo;batteries included&rdquo; <a href="https://github.com/techexpertize/SignApk">repo</a> claiming to do this for me. The signing worked, but the install still didn&rsquo;t. Maybe this was because the repo was eight years old? I found <a href="https://github.com/patrickfav/uber-apk-signer">a newer one</a> which happily signed my APK, but installation still failed, with the error <code>[INSTALL_PARSE_FAILED_UNEXPECTED_EXCEPTION: Failed to parse /data/app...AndroidManifest.xml]</code>. What was wrong the AndroidManifest.xml? I hadn&rsquo;t touched it, and I couldn&rsquo;t read it because it was compiled. (<a href="https://blogs.sap.com/2014/05/21/how-to-modify-an-apk-file/">Here</a> is a blog post from 2014, a more innocent time, which does what I did until here and succeeds.)</p>
<p>Time for the big guns. I downloaded <a href="https://ibotpeaches.github.io/Apktool/">Apktool</a>, a reverse-engineering tool that tries to restore the source. I was warned that this can break complicated apps, but the one I was editing is pretty simple and survived the compilation. Starting with my original <code>apk</code> file, I ran <code>apktool d myapp.apk</code>, edited the file in the assets, had a quick look at the now-readable <code>AndroidManifest.xml</code> (utterly ordinary, nothing of interest to see!), rebuilt the app with <code>apktool b myapp.zip.out -o edited_app.apk</code>, and then tried to install. No good - no certificate! Signed the new <code>apk</code> with <code>uber-apk-signer</code> and tried again: this time it was rejected with a new error: <code>[INSTALL_FAILED_UPDATE_INCOMPATIBLE]</code>. Looks like the problem is the old version existing on my phone. I uninstalled it, reran <code>adb install</code> and hey presto - it worked!</p>
<p>If this sounds like a tedious and horrible exercise to you, you&rsquo;re
probably right. But somehow my brain is wired to find the lure of the
solution greater than the frustration of the journey.</p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>Merely unzipping and editing doesn&rsquo;t work. Use <code>apktool</code> to reverse-engineer and a modern signing tool to generate a new signature</li>
<li>Uninstall the old version, and then <code>adb install</code>. (You&rsquo;ll lose your old settings, this way, so be ready to restore them.)</li>
<li>If you want to distribute your app to other people via the Play Store, you&rsquo;re beyond the scope of this post!</li>
</ul>
